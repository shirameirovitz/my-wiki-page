        The depiction of dreams in Renaissance and Baroque art is often 
        related to Biblical narrative. Examples are Joachim's Dream (1304–1306) 
        from the Scrovegni Chapel fresco cycle by Giotto, and Jacob's Dream (1639) by 
        Jusepe de Ribera. Dreams and dark imaginings are the theme of several notable 
        works of the Romantic era, such as Goya's etching The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters 
        (c. 1799) and Henry Fuseli's painting The Nightmare (1781). Salvador Dalí's Dream Caused 
        by the Flight of a Bee around a Pomegranate a Second Before Awakening (1944) also investigates 
        this theme through absurd juxtapositions of a nude lady, tigers leaping out of a pomegranate, 
        and a spiderlike elephant walking in the background. Henri Rousseau's last painting was The Dream. 
        Le Rêve ("The Dream") is a 1932 painting by Pablo Picasso. </p>

    <p> Further information: Dream world (plot device) Dream frames were frequently used in
        medieval allegory to justify the narrative; The Book of the Duchess[37] and The 
        Vision Concerning Piers Plowman are two such dream visions. Even before them, 
        in antiquity, the same device had been used by Cicero and Lucian of Samosata. 
        The Cheshire Cat vanishes in Wonderland They have also featured in fantasy and 
        speculative fiction since the 19th century. One of the best-known dream worlds is 
        Wonderland from Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, as well as Looking-Glass 
        Land from its sequel, Through the Looking-Glass. Unlike many dream worlds, Carroll's 
        logic is like that of actual dreams, with transitions and flexible causality.
        Other fictional dream worlds include the Dreamlands of H. P. Lovecraft's Dream Cycle and 
        The Neverending Story's world of Fantasia, which includes places like the Desert of Lost 
        Dreams, the Sea of Possibilities and the Swamps of Sadness. Dreamworlds, shared 
        hallucinations and other alternate realities feature in a number of works by Philip 
        K. Dick, such as The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch and Ubik. Similar themes were 
        explored by Jorge Luis Borges, for instance in The Circular Ruins.
