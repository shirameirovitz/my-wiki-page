        <p> A dream is a succession of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations 
            that usually occur involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep. 
            The content and function of dreams are not fully understood,
            although they have been a topic of scientific, philosophical and
            religious interest throughout recorded history. Dream interpretation
            is the attempt at drawing meaning from dreams and searching for 
            an underlying message. The scientific study of dreams is called oneirology.
            Dreams mainly occur in the rapid-eye movement (REM) stage of
            sleep—when brain activity is high and resembles that of  being awake.
            REM sleep is revealed by continuous movements of the eyes during sleep.
            At times, dreams may occur during other stages of sleep. However,
            these dreams tend to be much less vividor memorable. The length of
            a dream can vary;they may last for a few seconds, or approximately 
            20–30 minutes.People are more likely to remember the dream if they are
            awakened during the REM phase. The average person has three to five
            person has three to five dreams per night, and some may have up to seven;
            however, most dreams are immediately or quickly forgotten.
            Dreams tendto last longer as the night progresses. During a full
            eight-hour night sleep, most dreams occur in the typical two hours of REM.
            Dreams related to waking-life experiences are associated with REM theta
             activity, which suggests that emotional memory processing takes
              place in REM sleep.</p>
