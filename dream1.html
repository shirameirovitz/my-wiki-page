        In Judaism, dreams are considered part of the experience of the world
         that can be interpreted and from which lessons can be garnered. It is
          discussed in the Talmud, Tractate Berachot 55–60.

        The ancient Hebrews connected their dreams heavily with their religion,
        though the Hebrews were monotheistic and believed that dreams were the
        voice of one God alone. Hebrews also differentiated between good dreams 
        (from God) and bad dreams (from evil spirits). The Hebrews, like many
        other ancient cultures, incubated dreams in order to receive a divine
        revelation. For example, the Hebrew prophet Samuel would "lie down and
        sleep in the temple at Shiloh before the Ark and receive the word of
        the Lord." Most of the dreams in the Bible are in the Book of Genesis.

        Christians mostly shared the beliefs of the Hebrews and thought that 
        dreams were of a supernatural character because the Old Testament
        includes frequent stories of dreams with divine inspiration. The most
        famous of these dream stories was Jacob's dream of a ladder that stretches
        from Earth to Heaven. Many Christians preach that God can speak to
        people through their dreams. The famous glossary, the <i>Somniale Danielis</i>,
        written in the name of Daniel, attempted to teach Christian populations 
        to interpret their dreams.

        <i>Iain R. Edgar</i> has researched the role of dreams in Islam.[29] He has
        argued that dreams play an important role in the history of Islam and
        the lives of Muslims, since dream interpretation is the only way that
        Muslims can receive revelations from God since the death of the last
        prophet, Muhammad. According to Edgar, Islam classifies three types
        of dreams. Firstly, there is the true dream (al-ru’ya), then the false
        dream, which may come from the devil (shaytan), and finally, the meaningless
        everyday dream (hulm). This latter dream could be brought forth by the
        dreamer's ego or base appetite based on what they experienced in the real
        world. The true dream is often indicated by Islam's hadith tradition. In one 
        narration by Aisha, the wife of the Prophet, it is said that the Prophet's 
        dreams would come true like the ocean's waves. Just as in its 
        predecessors, the Quran also recounts the story of Joseph and his unique 
        ability to interpret dreams. </p>
        
        <h2 id="subtitle1">In Hinduism</h2>
        <p>In the Mandukya Upanishad, part of the Veda scriptures of Indian Hinduism, 
        a dream is one of three states that the soul experiences during its lifetime, 
        the other two states being the waking state and the sleep state.</p>
        
        <h2 id="subtitle2">In Buddhism</h2>
        <p>In Buddhism, ideas about dreams are similar to the classical and folk traditions 
        in South Asia. The same dream is sometimes experienced by multiple people, as in 
        the case of the Buddha-to-be, before he is leaving his home. It is described in 
        the Mahāvastu that several of the Buddha's relatives had premonitory dreams preceding 
        this. Some dreams are also seen to transcend time: the Buddha-to-be has certain dreams 
        that are the same as those of previous Buddhas, the Lalitavistara states. In Buddhist 
        literature, dreams often function as a "signpost" motif to mark certain stages in the 
        life of the main character. Buddhist views about dreams are expressed in the <i>Pāli </i>
        Commentaries and the <i>Milinda Pañhā.</i>
