    <p><b>Freud's view-</b>
        In the late 19th century, psychotherapist Sigmund Freud developed a 
        theory (since discredited) that the content of dreams is driven by 
        unconscious wish fulfillment. Freud called dreams the "royal road to the 
        unconscious." He theorized that the content of dreams reflects the 
        dreamer's unconscious mind and specifically that dream content is shaped 
        by unconscious wish fulfillment. He argued that important unconscious 
        desires often relate to early childhood memories and experiences. Freud's 
        theory describes dreams as having both manifest and latent content. Latent 
        content relates to deep unconscious wishes or fantasies while manifest content 
        is superficial and meaningless. Manifest content often masks or 
        obscures latent content. In his early work, Freud argued that the vast 
        majority of latent dream content is sexual in nature, but he later moved 
        away from this categorical position. In Beyond the Pleasure Principle he 
        considered how trauma or aggression could influence dream content. He 
        also discussed supernatural origins in Dreams and Occultism, a lecture 
        published in New Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis. Late in life 
        Freud acknowledged that "It is impossible to classify as wish fulfillments" 
        the repetitive nightmares associated with posttraumatic stress disorder. 
        Modern experimental studies weigh against many of Freud's theories regarding 
        dreams. Freud's "dream-work" interpretation strategies have not been found to 
        have empirical validity. His theory that dreams were the "guardians" of sleep, 
        repressing and disguising bodily urges to ensure sleep continues, seems unlikely 
        given studies of individuals who can sleep without dreaming. His assertions 
        that repressed memory in infants re-surface decades later in adult dreams 
        conflicts with modern research on memory. Freud's theory has difficulty explaining 
        why young children have static and bland dreams, or why the emotions in most dreams 
        are negative. On the plus side, modern researchers agree with Freud that dreams do 
        have coherence, and that dream content connects to other psychological variables and 
        often connect to recent waking thoughts (though not as often as Freud supposed). 
        Despite the lack of scientific evidence, dream interpretation services based on 
        Freudian or other systems remain popular. </p>

    <p><b>Jung's view-</b>Carl Jung rejected many of Freud's theories. Jung expanded on 
        Freud's idea that dream content relates to the dreamer's unconscious desires. 
        He described dreams as messages to the dreamer and argued that dreamers should 
        pay attention for their own good. He came to believe that dreams present the 
        dreamer with revelations that can uncover and help to resolve emotional or 
        religious problems and fears. Jung wrote that recurring dreams show up repeatedly 
        to demand attention, suggesting that the dreamer is neglecting an issue related 
        to the dream. He called this "compensation." The dream balances the conscious 
        belief and attitudes with an alternative. Jung did not believe that the conscious 
        attitude was wrong and that the dream provided the true belief. He argued that 
        good work with dreams takes both into account and comes up with a balanced viewpoint. 
        He believed that many of the symbols or images from these dreams return with each dream. 
        Jung believed that memories formed throughout the day also play a role in dreaming. 
        These memories leave impressions for the unconscious to deal with when the ego is at 
        rest. The unconscious mind re-enacts these glimpses of the past in the form of a dream. 
        Jung called this a day residue.[74] Jung also argued that dreaming is not a purely 
        individual concern, that all dreams are part of "one great web of psychological 
        factors."</p>
    </br>
    <p><i>Fritz Perls' view</i>Fritz Perls presented his theory of dreams as part of the holistic nature of Gestalt 
        therapy. Dreams are seen as projections of parts of the self that have been ignored, 
        rejected, or suppressed.[75] Jung argued that one could consider every person in the 
        dream to represent an aspect of the dreamer, which he called the subjective approach 
        to dreams. Perls expanded this point of view to say that even inanimate objects in 
        the dream may represent aspects of the dreamer. The dreamer may, therefore, be asked 
        to imagine being an object in the dream and to describe it, in order to bring into 
        awareness the characteristics of the object that correspond with the dreamer's personality.

    <p> Role in testing and selecting mental schemas Coutts describes dreams 
        as playing a central role in a two-phase sleep process that improves the 
        mind's ability to meet human needs during wakefulness. During the accommodation 
        phase, mental schemas self-modify by incorporating dream themes. During the emotional 
        selection phase, dreams test prior schema accommodations. Those that appear adaptive 
        are retained, while those that appear maladaptive are culled. The cycle maps to the 
        sleep cycle, repeating several times during a typical night's sleep. Alfred Adler 
        suggested that dreams are often emotional preparations for solving problems, intoxicating 
        an individual away from common sense toward private logic. The residual dream feelings may 
        either reinforce or inhibit contemplated action.

<p><b>Evolutionary psychology theories</b>Numerous theories state that dreaming is 
    a random by-product of REM sleep physiology and that it does not serve any natural 
    purpose. Flanagan claims that "dreams are evolutionary epiphenomena" and they have 
    no adaptive function. "Dreaming came along as a free ride on a system designed to 
    think and to sleep."J.A. Hobson, for different reasons, also considers dreams 
    epiphenomena. He believes that the substance of dreams have no significant influence 
    on waking actions, and most people go about their daily lives perfectly well without 
    remembering their dreams. Hobson proposed the activation-synthesis theory, which 
    states that "there is a randomness of dream imagery and the randomness synthesizes 
    dream-generated images to fit the patterns of internally generated stimulations". 
    This theory is based on the physiology of REM sleep, and Hobson believes dreams 
    are the outcome of the forebrain reacting to random activity beginning at the 
    brainstem. The activation-synthesis theory hypothesizes that the peculiar nature 
    of dreams is attributed to certain parts of the brain trying to piece together 
    a story out of what is essentially bizarre information. In 2005, Hobson 
    published a book, Thirteen Dreams that Freud Never Had, in which he analyzed 
    his own dreams after having a stroke in 2001. Some evolutionary psychologists 
    believe dreams serve some adaptive function for survival. Deirdre Barrett describes 
    dreaming as simply "thinking in different biochemical state" and believes people 
    continue to work on all the same problems—personal and objective—in that state. 
    Her research finds that anything—math, musical composition, business dilemmas—may 
    get solved during dreaming.Finnish psychologist Antti Revonsuo posits that dreams 
    have evolved for "threat simulation" exclusively. According to the Threat Simulation 
    Theory he proposes, during much of human evolution physical and interpersonal threats 
    were serious, giving reproductive advantage to those who survived them. Therefore, 
    dreaming evolved to replicate these threats and continually practice dealing with them. 
    In support of this theory, Revonsuo shows that contemporary dreams comprise much more 
    threatening events than people meet in daily non-dream life, and the dreamer usually 
    engages appropriately with them.[97] It is suggested by this theory that dreams serve 
    the purpose of allowing for the rehearsal of threatening scenarios in order to better 
    prepare an individual for real-life threats. According to Tsoukalas (2012) the biology 
    of dreaming is related to the reactive patterns elicited by predatorial encounters 
    (especially the tonic immobility reflex), a fact that lends support to evolutionary 
    theories claiming that dreams specialize in threat avoidance or emotional processing.
